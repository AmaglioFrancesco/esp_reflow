# Reflow soldering system based on a flat iron heater 

## Hardware

The system is based on a flat iron heater source, controlled by an esp32 microcontroller that acts as a PID system by controlling the temperature of the metal surface.

The components needed for the projects are:
*  ESP32 module that is wifi-capable (in my case i used ESP32-S3 dev module)
*  Flat iron heater disassembled
*  Thermocouple module (I used max6675 module)
*  Solid state Relay 
*  AC-DC converter from 220VAC to 5VDC to power the esp module
* On/Off switch 

### Connections

The image below shows the connections between all the components\
*The README document, as the documentation about the hardware and the final tests on the code are WIP. The main structure of the code should instead be already fruible*

## Code

The code works by creating a local webserver, that wait for datas input by the user, and then start the reflow process, getting the temperature readings from the thermocouple and regulating the SSR output to consequence. All the process can be monitored in the webserver with a real time chart of the temperature.

There are different files in the code directory:
* data folder: stores the HTML source of webpage, the CSS and the JS scripts of the server "brain"
* src folder: stores the main cpp code that should be loaded on the esp, and eventual header files 

Other folders are automatically generated by the environment (Platformio).

The code create also a filesystem in the esp memory, that help the program to store all the html and js files for the webserver

### Compiling the code

To properly compile the code on the microcontroller, follow these steps:
1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in the VSCode IDE
2. In the IDE, click on the alien icon and, in the "Project Tasks" section, under "Platform" folder, click "Build Filesystem Image"
3. Under the same folder, click "Upload Filesystem image"
4. Compile the "main.cpp" code on the microcontroller

Note that, with the steps 2 and 3 you are building the filesystem image that will be used by SPIFFS library.\

## Test

*Test of the code are still work in progress*

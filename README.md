# Reflow soldering system based on a flat iron heater 

## Hardware

The system is based on a flat iron heater source, controlled by an esp32 microcontroller that acts as a PID system by controlling the temperature of the metal surface.

The components needed for the projects are:
*  ESP32 module that is wifi-capable (in my case i used ESP32-S3 dev module)
*  Flat iron heater disassembled
*  Thermocouple module (I used max6675 module)
*  Solid state Relay 
*  AC-DC converter from 220VAC to 5VDC to power the esp module
* On/Off switch

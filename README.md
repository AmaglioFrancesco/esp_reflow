# Reflow soldering system based on a flat iron heater 
Reflow station that forces a flat iron to follow a [reflow soldering temperature curve](https://www.compuphase.com/electronics/solderprofile-standard.png), with customizable temperature and times values.\
Based on the ESP32-s3 devBoard.\
All the system is controlled via a Webserver hosted by the microcontroller that recieves values for the reflow and show the real time graphic of temperature.

## Hardware


The components needed for the projects are:
*  ESP32 module that is wifi-capable (in my case i used ESP32-S3 dev module)
*  Flat iron heater plate (reccomended 1 to 3 kW of heater power)
*  Thermocouple module (I used max6675 module)
*  Solid state Relay (SSR)
*  AC-DC converter from 220VAC to 5VDC to power the esp module
* On/Off switch 

### Connections

The image below shows the connections between all the components\
*The README document, as the documentation about the hardware and the final tests on the code are WIP. The main structure of the code should instead be already fruible*

## Code

The code works by creating a local webserver, that wait for datas input by the user, and then start the reflow process, getting the temperature readings from the thermocouple and regulating the SSR output to consequence. All the process can be monitored in the webserver with a real time chart of the temperature.

### Relevant code files

Important files
* data folder: Stores HTML, CSS andJS for the webserver
* src folder: Stores main.cpp, that is the main microcontroller file, and eventual header files

Other folders are automatically generated by the environment (Platformio).

The code create also a filesystem in the esp memory, that help the program to store all the html and js files for the webserver
### Libraries

### Compiling the code

To properly compile the code on the microcontroller, follow these steps:
1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in the VSCode IDE
2. In the IDE, click on the alien icon and, in the "Project Tasks" section, under "Platform" folder, click "Build Filesystem Image"
3. Under the same folder, click "Upload Filesystem image"
4. Compile the "main.cpp" code on the microcontroller

Note that, with the steps 2 and 3 you are building the filesystem image that will be used by SPIFFS library.\

## Test

*Test of the code are still work in progress*
